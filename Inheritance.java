/*
 In the Java language, classes can be derived from other classes, thereby inheriting fields and methods from those classes. 
 */
 An Example of Inheritance
Here is the sample code for a possible implementation of a Bicycle class that was presented in the Classes and Objects lesson:

public class Bicycle {
	
    // the Bicycle class has three fields
    public int cadence;
    public int gear;
    public int speed;
	
    // the Bicycle class has one constructor
    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
        gear = startGear;
        cadence = startCadence;
        speed = startSpeed;
    }
	
    // the Bicycle class has four methods
    public void setCadence(int newValue) {
        cadence = newValue;
    }
	
    public void setGear(int newValue) {
        gear = newValue;
    }
	
    public void applyBrake(int decrement) {
        speed -= decrement;
    }
	
    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
    }
	
}

A class declaration for a MountainBike class that is a subclass of Bicycle might look like this:

public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {
	
    // the MountainBike subclass adds one field
    public int seatHeight;

    // the MountainBike subclass has one constructor
    public MountainBike(int startHeight, int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);
        seatHeight = startHeight;
    }	
	
    // the MountainBike subclass adds one method
    public void setHeight(int newValue) {
        seatHeight = newValue;
    }	

}
