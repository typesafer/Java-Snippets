/**
1. Member variables in a class—these are called fields.

2. Variables in a method or block of code—these are called local variables.

3. Variables in method declarations—these are called parameters. 


Field declarations are composed of three components, in order:

    Zero or more modifiers, such as public or private.
    The field's type.
    The field's name.

Access Modifiers


    public modifier—the field is accessible from all classes.
    private modifier—the field is accessible only within its own class.
